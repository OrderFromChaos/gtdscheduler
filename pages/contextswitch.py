class contextswitch:
    # Want contexts to be searchable easily
    # "a" for adding context
    # "d" for context deletion UI (are you sure? currently has X tasks; show a few of them)
    #     no by default (of course)
    # "e" to rename (input box needs option to prefill)
    # "s" -> alpha input with bisect_left on each step
    #     shift-enter to immediately switch to said context
    # scrolling ui, a la old school rotary phones
    # TODO: add context indicator on other pages
